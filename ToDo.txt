ToDo list:
	- Solve incorrect decoding when using more than one source block
	- Re-write the decoding code to tolerate unordered encoding symbols
	- Look at optimizations for the Permanent Inactivation Decoding 
		(there's some algorithmic problem causing too much complexity -- namely in the first phase)
