# This file contains K' values for which an optimized decoder is available.

# Each K' value must be defined in a new line.
# Empty lines and lines that begin with a # are ignored by the parser. Since the
# maximum K' is 56403, lines that have more than 5 characters are also ignored.
# Finally, unknown values of K' are ignored as well.

# An implementation of an optimized decoder must be a subclass of
# net.fec.openrq.util.rq.IntermediateSymbolsDecoder
# and must have a name with the following format: "ISD_{K'}.class"
# with the K' value supported by the implementation
